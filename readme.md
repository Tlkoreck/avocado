Front-End Web Development Project Requirements
Project Deadline: Last Friday of the class, by 11:59am

There will be a form provided approximately 2 weeks prior to the due date that you will complete to “turn-in” your project. 

Late projects will not be accepted


The purpose of the capstone project is to reinforce what you’ve learned and show off your skills. Your projects will be your go-to tool to show off to potential employers and demonstrate you know what you’re talking about. Pick an idea that is fun, challenging, and hopefully useful, too!

Create a website that demonstrates your knowledge of the Front-end development skills you’ve been learning. This application can be anything of your choosing as long as it demonstrates the below requirements. 

Requirements
The below items are the requirements for your personal project for the Front-end class. Projects are graded on a pass/fail system, thus every required bullet must be met in order for your project to pass. You should discuss your project/plan with mentors in advance to verify that it will meet the requirements, but also to make sure you don't tackle too large of a project for this class. 

Failure to meet all requirements will result in you not completing the class, and you will be unable to continue with the program. Program staff and mentors will review projects after they are turned in and will determine if your project meets these requirements.

Feature Requirements:
    Choose a minimum of 3 of the below features and incorporate into your site

    A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a “hamburger” menu) 

    Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes

    Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout 

    Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input (for example, it checks to ensure email is the a@b.com format

    Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action (ex: clicking a button).

    Use JavaScript to perform math operations and display the result on your site

    Create and populate a JavaScript array, then retrieve and display one or more values from it

    Use “:nth child” CSS to style a series of elements (for example, change the color of every 2nd item in a list)

    Import Bootstrap from a CDN and use its column system to create a responsive design

    Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through

    Other features can be added to this list - just ask if your project needs something specific and as long as it’s a good demonstration of your programming skills, it almost certainly will count! Basically, we just want to see you do something interesting and challenging!

Additional Requirements
ALL of the below requirements must be met.

    Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes and improves the user experience in some way

    We will look at your app on a desktop screen and a mobile device to see what changes occur
    We must be able to see the change that your code is making on your website - a media query can be written correctly but have no actual effect. That will not be ok in this class.

    Your project includes at minimum 3 custom-written CSS elements (selectors, classes, etc) located in a .css file which are applied to your HTML elements
    The CSS must be included in its own file, not “in-line” on your HTML page - we want to see that you can properly “link” a stylesheet

    Many of the options in the first requirement will also fulfil this requirement

    Your project includes JavaScript in a separate .js file

    Script tags in your HTML file must execute the JS file

    Many of the options in the first requirement will also fulfil this requirement

    Your code have comments that document major sections of your code to make it easier to read
    You don’t need to go crazy on this - a few code comments are perfectly fine

    Your project code is uploaded to your GitHub account, in its own repository, with at least 5 commits

    We need to see that you’ve used Git to update your GitHub profile at least 5 times

    Using GitHub’s file uploader does not count as a check-in. You must upload via Git. 

It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project that includes:
        A description of your project

        What features you chose to included (so we know what to look for)
        
        Any special instructions we might need to run your project




Clarifications and Commonly Asked Questions
How projects are reviewed
The project reviewer will use git to clone your project to their local machine and open index.html (or whatever your readme indicates)
Responsive design will be tested using browser tools to simulate one or more mobile and/or tablet devices
If all the minimum requirements are met, your project passes
We are looking to ensure you understand what you wrote, so a poorly implemented project may still not pass if we believe you do not understand the code
Naming your project
Choose a name for your GitHub repo that is relevant to the subject of your project. Do not name your repo "CodeLouisvilleProject" or similar. Choose a name based on what your project is about. For example “Brian’s House of Pancakes”, “Personal Portfolio Site”, etc
Responsive Design
Your site/app must improve user experience with its responsive design, such as making the page easier to view or read, rearranging content, swapping in different assets, etc.
Swapping the color of your font or changing a background image/color is not demonstrating an improved experience and will not count.
Setting a width, such as 100% width on an image, that causes the content area to scale with the screen will NOT meet this requirement
You do not have to account for all possible devices and browser sizes, just demonstrate some responsive layout principles
GitHub
If you choose to host your application on a live URL, great! You can share that for demonstration purposes or ease of running - and this is encouraged! But your code must still be available on GitHub for review.
Check out GitHub pages (https://pages.github.com/) for a quick way to host your site
Yes, GitHub is a requirement. It’s not just how we find and view your project, it’s a critical skill you need to understand. Not having your project checked in on GitHub will result in not completing the class.
Testing Your Project
You should test your project on another computer by having someone else obtain and run your project. Several projects in the past have failed to meet requirements because it was written in a way that only worked on that person's computer and not the reviewer's. Your project reviewer will not be responsible for tracking down why your project does not work and this may result in a failed project.
Mentors
You should talk about your project early and often with your mentors. Explain your idea and the features you are thinking of implementing. They will help you understand if it will meet the requirements or if you've possibly decided to tackle too large of a project for the 12-week time period. Towards the end of the session, you should again show your project to your mentors and get confirmation that it meets the requirements of the project. You are perfectly fine to ask them to confirm so there should be no surprises about whether your project will meet the requirements when it comes time to submit.
